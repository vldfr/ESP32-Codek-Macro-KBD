# ESP32-Codek-Macro-KBD
This is a repository for an ESP32 variant of the Codek Macro Keyboard(Thingiverse). 

Hardware Components:
- ESP32 (MCU)
- TP4056 (Li-Ion Battery Charger)
- Power Switch
- 3.3v Step-Down Converter (I used one that can go as low as 3.4v on the input side)
- 10 Mechanical Keyboard Switches (I used ones from a broken mechanical Keyboard)
- SSD1306 OLED display (0.96")


# Credits
I want to thank Tanmay Burde for the great design that inspired me to make this SW/HW adaptation to his published design on Thingiverse which I found during my search for a nice case for a Macro Keyboard. The fact that it also has a built-in OLED display mount just made it better and made me want to build it, and with his approval I started this Repo after developing a first stable working version.
